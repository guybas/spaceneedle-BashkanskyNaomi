/**
 * Unit 2 Project
 * 
 * In this project you have the opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge of for loops
 * and nested for loops. Using the already created file named `SpaceNeedle.java` write a 
 * program that outputs an ASCII art version of the Space Needle. The goal of this 
 * project is to use ONLY what we have learned in Unit 2 (and prior) to create the Space 
 * Needle. Your code must be broken up into methods as appropriate and have comments 
 * describing what each method does.  
 * 
 * For those of you who have dabbled in coding before, try to contain your code to 
 * just what we have discussed in this (and previous) unit.
